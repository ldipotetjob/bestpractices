## Alternatives for cassandra on Kubernetes 

* Cassandra on EC2 images 
* Amazon Keyspaces [released on 2020]
* Cassandra on k8s Cluster [EKS]/EC2 Images 
 
After having a looks we think that perhaps in the future Amazon Key Spaces could be a feasible choice but not in this momment 
because its complexity.

**The 2 first rows in the table below are the EC2 amis recommended as best practice.**Those instances offer 10–Gb/s performance.**

**The 2 last row in the table below have been tested in a moderated production environment and looks quite well.**

Ec2 amis/Region Ireland:

| EC2 Ami       | vCPU          | ECU   | Memory (GiB)  | Instance Storage (GB) | Linux/UNIX Usage |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|--------------:|----------------------:|-----------------:|
| c5d.9xlarge   | 36            | 139   | 72            | 1 x 900 NVMe SSD      | $1.962 per Hour  |
| i3.8xlarge    | 32            | 97    | 244           | 4 x 1900 NVMe SSD     | $1.962 per Hour  |
| m5.large      | 2             | 10    | 8             | EBS Only              | $0.107 per Hour  |
| m5.xlarge     | 4             | 16    | 16            | EBS Only              | $0.214 per Hour  |

Consistency Levels(number of replicas that must answer[Read/Writes]):

ONE: Only a single replica must respond.</br>
TWO: Two replicas must respond.</br>
THREE: Three replicas must respond.</br> 
QUORUM:</br> 
 A majority (n/2 + 1) of the replicas must respond. Must be rounded down. n:node
 In an scenario with 3 nodes only 2 noders must respond so in the worst case one node canbe down and the System must work without any problem.  

#### Replication Factor

* Avoid keyspace with different replication factor. [It cans potentially cause hot spots.]

#### Tokens

* Review token value. Default value = 256. Check algorithm how to assign tokens to nodes

**Ensure Keyspaces are Created with NetworkTopologyStrategy** </br>


#### Reminder for full backup 

* flush in-memory data (Memtables) to the disk (SSTables)

Docker File Best Practices and some interesting reference links 
. Create ephimeral Conatiner 
. Understand your build context and the best way to stdn in 
. Exclude no relevant files to your build
. Leverage build cache. If build contain several layer order them from less frecuently changed(ti ensure that build code is reusable) to more frecuently used:
   - tools for build your apps
   - install/update libs 
   - generate app
 . decouple app 1app - each container 
 . use linter tools example like Docker File linter tool(https://hadolint.github.io/hadolint/)

Don't use nacked pods 
Create a Service before its corresponding backend workloads (Deployments or ReplicaSets), and before any workloads that need to access it.
An optional (though strongly recommended) cluster add-on is a DNS server
Don't specify a hostPort for a Pod unless it is absolutely necessary
Avoid using hostNetwork
Use headless Services (which have a ClusterIP of None) for easy service discovery when you don't need kube-proxy load balancing.
Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment, such as { app: myapp, tier: frontend, phase: test, deployment: v3 }
Have a look at the imagePullPolicy that fit better to your installation.
